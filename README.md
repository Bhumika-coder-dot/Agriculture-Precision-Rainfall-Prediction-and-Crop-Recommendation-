# Agriculture-Precision-Rainfall-Prediction-and-Crop-Recommendation-
Demonstrates web application of machine learning models in agriculture through integration of rainfall prediction and crop recommendation systems
Here’s a **README.md** file tailored for a **Rainfall Prediction and Crop Recommendation Website using Machine Learning**, designed to be run on **VS Code**.

---

---

## Features
- **Rainfall Prediction**: Uses historical weather data and machine learning models to predict rainfall.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Recommends crops based on rainfall, soil type, temperature, and other parameters.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Users can input data through a form on the website and receive predictions in real time.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Easily extendable for other weather predictions and crop analytics.

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Software Requirements:
- **Visual Studio Code**: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** (optional): For cloning the repository.
  
### 2. Python Packages:
Install the following packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example `requirements.txt`:
```
flask
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd rainfall-crop-recommendation
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Start the Flask Server
Make sure you are in the project directory and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 5: Open the Website
Open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## How It Works

1. **Rainfall Prediction**:
   - Uses weather data such as humidity, temperature, and previous rainfall.
   - Machine learning model decision tree trained on historical data to make predictions.

2. **Crop Recommendation**:
   - Based on predicted rainfall, soil type, and weather parameters, the application suggests the most suitable crops.
   - Uses models decision tree for recommendations.

3. **Web Interface**:
   - Users input parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil type.
   - The models predict rainfall and recommend crops in real time.

---

## Example Usage

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Enter weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).
3. Click on "Predict".
4. The website will display the predicted rainfall and recommended crops.

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: For the web interface.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations.

---

## Future Improvements
- Integrate **real-time weather APIs** for up-to-date predictions.
- Add **more crop recommendations** based on market trends and soil conditions.
- Deploy the application on **cloud platforms** like AWS or Heroku.
